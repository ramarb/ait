The page is working and deployed, however the task was not exactly as it suppose to be because I have a feelings that I'm the one that AI is looking for

Deployed to Heroku on the following domain

http://ait-ramonito.herokuapp.com/

-the page displays images tagged with "inspection"
-the page allow the user to search other photos using tags as keywords
-the app uses angular, bootstap and laravel frameworks
